# Third-Eye-GDIT
# This project is a facial recognition application that provides users an extra security measure at their workplace. It serves as a surveillance for their device and warns the user if there is an unauthorized person looking at/trying to use the device. This was done as part of Summer 2020 internship at General Dynamics.
